## Notes:
Before using this utility with a live private key, ensure the following steps have been taken:
1) Disconnect from the internet.
2) Make sure that you are alone, on a machine that you own, in a private place (i.e. somewhere no-one can see your screen)
3) Do NOT store the output of this program in a file on an internet-capable machine. Remember that even deleting the file is not enough to remove the key completely from disk.

### For the paranoid:
1) Only run this application on a system that has never been, and never will be, attached to the internet.
2) Boot into a secure memory-only OS, such as Tails
3) Do not print the output of this program, as most modern printers contain non-volatile storage and can connect to the internet.
4) When coping by hand onto paper, make sure that pen imprints do not transfer to pages below.
